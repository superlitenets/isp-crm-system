That output is actually the smoking gun — and it’s good news 😄
It tells us exactly why the redirect is failing and exactly how to fix it.

What MikroTik just told you (very important)
Fetch failed with status 301
Location: https://crm.superlite.co.ke/expired


Meaning:

✅ HTTP (port 80) is reachable

❌ Server responds with 301 redirect to HTTPS

❌ MikroTik HTTP proxy cannot follow HTTPS redirects

So the proxy sends the user to HTTP…
Then your server immediately jumps to HTTPS…
And the proxy + firewall blocks it → ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE

✔️ CORRECT FIX (THIS is the fix, not MikroTik)

You must allow HTTP access to /expired without forcing HTTPS.

Rule of thumb

Expired page must be pure HTTP
Payment action can go HTTPS after button click

This is how legacy PPPoE redirects work.

OPTION A (BEST PRACTICE – RECOMMENDED)
Allow /expired on HTTP (no redirect)

On your web server:

🔹 NGINX
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name crm.superlite.co.ke;

    location /expired {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    # Optional: force HTTPS for everything else
    location / {
        return 301 https://crm.superlite.co.ke$request_uri;
    }
}


Then inside /expired page:

Show message

“Pay Now” button → HTTPS checkout

OPTION B (If you insist on HTTPS – workaround)

Use TWO-STAGE redirect:

1️⃣ Proxy redirects to a HTTP landing page
http://crm.superlite.co.ke/expired-http

2️⃣ That page uses JS button:
<button onclick="window.location.href='https://crm.superlite.co.ke/expired'">
Pay Now
</button>


🚫 Do NOT auto-redirect to HTTPS.

OPTION C (NOT recommended but works)

Disable proxy method entirely
Move to firewall allow-only CRM IP method (modern approach)

I can guide you if you want.

Why HTTPS auto-redirect breaks PPPoE

MikroTik proxy is HTTP-only

Cannot MITM TLS

Cannot follow 301 → HTTPS

Browser sees unreachable path

This is normal MikroTik behavior, not a bug.

After you fix server config

Test again:

/tool fetch url="http://crm.superlite.co.ke/expired"


You want:

status: finished

Final verdict 🎯

Your MikroTik config is correct
Your DNS is correct
Your IP is correct

The only problem is:

HTTP → HTTPS auto redirect on /expired

Fix that, and your redirect will work instantly.
