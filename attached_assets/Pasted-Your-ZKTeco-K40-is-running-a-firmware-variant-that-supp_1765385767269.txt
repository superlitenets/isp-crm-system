Your ZKTeco K40 is running a firmware variant that supports “Push Protocol” for BioTime, which allows server-side enrollment
BUT this is not the same as API-based enrollment, and only works through BioTime’s built-in commands.

Let’s break it down clearly:

✅ Yes — K40 can enroll via BioTime

But only because:

✔ K40 supports ZKTeco Push Protocol (Web-based push mode)
✔ BioTime uses the ZKTeco device SDK (Push SDK)
✔ BioTime sends a special internal command to the device to begin fingerprint capture

This is NOT an open API like Hikvision ISAPI.

It’s a ZKTeco-only protocol.

🔍 Important details about this feature
1. Only K40 devices with Push firmware support BioTime enrollment

Some K40 units have:

Push firmware → works with BioTime (remote FP enroll)

Attendance firmware → does not support remote FP enroll

You are lucky — your K40 has the Push-enabled firmware.

2. Remote enrollment works only through BioTime, not custom API

BioTime sends an internal SDK command:

ATT_ENROLL_USER
ATT_CAPTURE_FINGERPRINT


These commands are not documented publicly, so you cannot call them from your own application unless you use:

ZKTeco Push SDK

zkemkeeper DLL (Windows only, legacy)

A third-party ZKTeco wrapper

3. K40 enrolls via BioTime because:

BioTime does this sequence:

Sends command “start enrollment” to device

Device screen shows: Place Finger

Device captures the fingerprint data

Device pushes the fingerprint template to BioTime

BioTime sends template back to device for confirmation/sync

This is not standard API — it’s ZKTeco SDK communication.

🧩 Summary
Feature	K40 + Typical Firmware	K40 + Push Firmware
Local FP enrollment	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Remote FP via BioTime	❌ No	✅ Yes
Remote FP via your custom API	❌ No	⚠️ Possible only via SDK
Pull attendance logs	✔️ Yes	✔️ Yes
Upload fingerprint templates manually	❌ No	⚠️ Only via SDK
Rest/HTTP API	❌ None	❌ None
⭐ Want the same fingerprint enrollment in your own app?

You have two options:

✔ Option 1: Use ZKTeco Push SDK (recommended)

With the Push SDK, you can:

Trigger enrollment

Capture fingerprints

Add users

Sync templates

Pull attendance logs
