📌 Core OLT Provisioning Features
1. Automatic ONT/ONU Provisioning

Huawei OLT provisioning systems typically support:

Automatic device registration of ONTs/ONUs as soon as they connect.

Auto-configuration of subscriber services via provisioning profiles — like service packages for internet, IPTV, VoIP, etc.

Automatic provisioning using TR-069 with an ACS (Auto-Configuration Server) for remote CPE management, zero-touch deployment and configuration delivery.
TR-069 provisioning allows an ACS to manage ONTs independently of the OLT protocol (OMCI handles the PON link layer while TR-069 handles IP-based management).

🛠️ Configuration & Management Capabilities
2. OLT & ONT Parameter Management

Provisioning systems let you:

Create and assign service profiles for different customer packages.

Configure ONT parameters (VLANs, QoS, WAN profiles, voice/VoIP, etc.).

Manage lifecycle operations: activation, suspension, deletion, and re-assignment.

3. Remote Administration

Systems can:

Remotely manage ONTs (change configs without field visits).

Push firmware and configuration updates.

Collect performance and status metrics.

Remotely locate and diagnose issues via OMS/OMCI/TR-069 channels.

4. Built-In DHCP & IP Services

Many provisioning platforms include:

Built-in DHCP server capabilities.

IP pool management for subscriber ONTs and services.

Support for DHCP options relevant to PON deployments (e.g., Option 82).

📈 Billing & Integration Features
5. API and OSS/BSS Integration

Advanced provisioning systems often include:

Open APIs to integrate with billing, CRM, and OSS/BSS systems.

Ability to automate OSS/BSS workflows like service order fulfillment, billing triggers, service change orders, etc.

6. Multi-Operator Support

Some provisioning tools offer:

Support for multiple operators sharing the same physical OLT while keeping operator data isolated and secure.

Enables network sharing with tenant isolation, useful in wholesale/neutral-host models.

📊 Monitoring, Reporting & Logs
7. Statistics & Logs

Typical systems can:

Record OLT and ONT statistics such as traffic, uptime, errors, etc.

Produce logs for provisioning actions and service state changes.

Offer alerts and notifications for provisioning events (e.g., provisioning success/failures).

8. Status & Fault Detection

Provisioning often includes:

Real-time or periodic reporting of ONT/OLT alarms and fault conditions.

Integration with NMS (Network Management Systems) for holistic network fault monitoring.

Ability to correlate uplink/downlink failures and service degradations.

⚙️ Service & Network Features Tied to Provisioning
9. Service Profiles & VLAN/QoS Support

Huawei OLT provisioning allows you to define:

VLAN and service profile templates — internet, enterprise services, IPTV, voice, etc.

QoS policies applied automatically during onboarding.

10. TR-069 & OMCI Hybrid Management

OMCI (ONT Management Control Interface) handles PON link layer and service configurations.

TR-069 (often with ACS) handles IP-based service provisioning, monitoring, and remote management of customer premises equipment.
This hybrid approach greatly reduces manual configuration
