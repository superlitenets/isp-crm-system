0.995 Verifying lock file contents can be installed on current platform.
1.069 Warning: The lock file is not up to date with the latest changes in composer.json. You may be getting outdated dependencies. It is recommended that you run `composer update` or `composer update <package name>`.
1.071 - Required package "coding-libs/zkteco-php" is not present in the lock file.
1.071 This usually happens when composer files are incorrectly merged or the composer.json file is manually edited.
1.071 Read more about correctly resolving merge conflicts https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/resolving-merge-conflicts.md
1.071 and prefer using the "require" command over editing the composer.json file directly https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#require-r

4.768 Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.
4.768
4.768   Problem 1
4.768     - Root composer.json requires coding-libs/zkteco-php ^1.0, found coding-libs/zkteco-php[dev-master, 1.x-dev (alias of dev-master)] but it does not match your minimum-stability.
4.768   Problem 2
4.768     - Root composer.json requires phpoffice/phpspreadsheet ^5.3 -> satisfiable by phpoffice/phpspreadsheet[5.3.0].
4.768     - phpoffice/phpspreadsheet 5.3.0 requires ext-gd * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's gd extension.
4.768
4.768 To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
4.768     - /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini
4.768     - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-fpm.ini
4.768     - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-intl.ini
4.768     - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-opcache.ini
4.768     - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-pdo_pgsql.ini
4.768     - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sockets.ini
4.768     - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
4.768     - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-zip.ini
4.768     - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/opcache.ini
4.768     - /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/timezone.ini
4.768 You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
4.768 Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-gd` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.
4.768 Running update with --no-dev does not mean require-dev is ignored, it just means the packages will not be installed. If dev requirements are blocking the update you have to resolve those problems.
