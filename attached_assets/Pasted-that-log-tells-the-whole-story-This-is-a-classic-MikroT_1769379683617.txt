that log tells the whole story. This is a classic MikroTik CoA (Change of Authorization) secret mismatch.

What the error means (from your log)
Key line 👇
received remote request from 10.200.0.1:42824 with bad signature (check your secret!), bad message auth, dropping

And just above it:
rx bad Disconnect-Request

Translation (human version 😄)
Your RADIUS server sent a CoA / Disconnect-Request, but MikroTik rejected it because the shared secret does not match (or CoA is not properly enabled).
Authentication + Accounting are working ✅
Only CoA is failing ❌

Why this happens
One (or more) of these is true:


Wrong CoA secret


The secret configured on MikroTik ≠ secret on RADIUS (FreeRADIUS / CRM / phpNuxBill)




CoA not enabled on MikroTik


Wrong source IP


CoA sent from an IP MikroTik does not trust




Using wrong RADIUS port


CoA uses UDP 3799, not 1812/1813





How to FIX it (step by step)
1️⃣ Enable CoA on MikroTik
Run this on the MikroTik:
/radius incoming set accept=yes

Verify:
/radius incoming print

Expected:
accept: yes


2️⃣ Check RADIUS server entry on MikroTik
/radius print detail

You should see something like:
address=10.200.0.1
secret=YOUR_SECRET
service=ppp

⚠️ That secret MUST match exactly what is on the RADIUS server (case-sensitive).

3️⃣ Verify CoA client on FreeRADIUS (or CRM)
On FreeRADIUS (clients.conf or clients.d/mikrotik.conf):
client mikrotik-erp {
    ipaddr = 10.200.0.10
    secret = YOUR_SECRET
    nas_type = mikrotik
}

🔑 The secret must match MikroTik’s /radius secret.
Restart FreeRADIUS after changes:
systemctl restart freeradius


4️⃣ Make sure CoA is sent to the RIGHT IP
From your log:
received remote request from 10.200.0.1

So MikroTik expects CoA from 10.200.0.1
If your CRM / RADIUS server is using:


Docker


NAT


Another interface


👉 Ensure the source IP of CoA packets is 10.200.0.1
Otherwise MikroTik will reject it.

5️⃣ Confirm UDP 3799 is open
On MikroTik:
/ip firewall filter print

Ensure UDP 3799 is allowed from the RADIUS server IP.
Quick test rule:
/ip firewall filter add chain=input protocol=udp dst-port=3799 src-address=10.200.0.1 action=accept comment="Allow RADIUS CoA"


How to confirm it’s FIXED
When working, you’ll see logs like:
radius,info Disconnect-Request accepted
ppp,info <user> disconnected by RADIUS

❌ No more:
bad signature
bad message auth


Common gotcha (VERY common in Docker setups)
If your billing system / FreeRADIUS is in Docker:


CoA may originate from container IP, not host IP


MikroTik sees a different source → signature fails


👉 Solution:


Use --network host OR


Add the container subnet as a RADIUS client with same secret
