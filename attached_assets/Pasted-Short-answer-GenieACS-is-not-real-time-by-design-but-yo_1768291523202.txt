Short answer: ❌ GenieACS is not “real-time” by design — but ✅ you can make it near-real-time in a controlled, production-safe way.

This is exactly the same model used by SmartOLT and other ISP ACS platforms.

I’ll explain this clearly and practically.

What “real-time” actually means in TR-069

First, an important truth:

TR-069 is a pull-based protocol, not push-based.

That means:

The ONU decides when it talks

The ACS (GenieACS) cannot instantly push config unless the device is online and reachable

So true real-time (milliseconds) like SNMP or WebSockets is impossible with TR-069.

This is not a GenieACS limitation — it’s the protocol itself.

How GenieACS actually works

GenieACS operates on CWMP sessions:

ONU → Inform → ACS → Tasks → Response → Done


Triggers for an Inform:

Boot

PeriodicInformInterval

Parameter change

Connection Request (if reachable)

The GOOD NEWS: you can make GenieACS near-real-time
SmartOLT does exactly this 👇
1️⃣ Use Connection Requests (this is the key)

If the ONU supports it (Huawei does):

ACS → ConnectionRequest → ONU → Inform


Latency:

Typically 1–5 seconds

Sometimes instant on LAN

This is the fastest possible TR-069 flow.

2️⃣ Reduce Periodic Inform interval (safely)

Default is often:

3600 seconds (1 hour)


SmartOLT usually sets:

300–900 seconds


You can do the same:

InternetGatewayDevice.ManagementServer.PeriodicInformInterval = 300


⚠️ Do NOT go below 120 seconds in production.

3️⃣ Event-driven provisioning (CRM-controlled)

Instead of waiting for periodic inform:

CRM action →
  GenieACS task →
    ConnectionRequest →
      ONU informs →
        task executes


From the user’s point of view:
👉 This feels real-time

What GenieACS CANNOT do (important)

❌ Push config if ONU is offline
❌ Push config if NAT blocks connection request
❌ React instantly to LAN/Wi-Fi events
❌ Replace SNMP for optics monitoring

This is why SmartOLT still uses:

SNMP for optics

TR-069 for provisioning

Real-time patterns that actually WORK (used by ISPs)
✅ Pattern A — “Near-real-time provisioning” (recommended)

Used for:

PPPoE changes

VLAN changes

Wi-Fi updates

Service activation/suspension

Latency:

1–10 seconds

How:

GenieACS + ConnectionRequest

✅ Pattern B — Hybrid real-time (best practice)
SNMP / gRPC / Netconf → realtime telemetry
TR-069 (GenieACS)     → configuration


SmartOLT, Huawei U2000, ZTE ZSmart all do this.

Why your system already supports near-real-time

From your current design:

✔ Single ACS
✔ GenieACS Tasks API
✔ CRM-triggered provisioning
✔ No conflicting writers

You already have 90% of real-time behavior.

You just need to use connection requests aggressively.

Practical checklist to make GenieACS feel real-time
✅ MUST DO

Enable ConnectionRequestURL on ONU

Store ONU IP / ACS reachability

Trigger connection_request when provisioning

Lower PeriodicInformInterval to 300–600s

❌ DO NOT DO

Don’t poll constantly

Don’t provision on every inform

Don’t expect millisecond response

Don’t mix CLI/Web/SNMP config

Honest comparison
Feature	GenieACS	SmartOLT
True real-time	❌	❌
Near-real-time	✅	✅
Safe at scale	✅	✅
CRM-driven	✅	✅
Protocol limit	TR-069	TR-069

SmartOLT is not more real-time than GenieACS — it just hides the delay well.

Final answer (clear)

👉 You cannot make GenieACS truly real-time.
👉 You CAN make it feel real-time (1–5 seconds) — which is the best TR-069 allows.
👉 Your current architecture is already correct for this.
