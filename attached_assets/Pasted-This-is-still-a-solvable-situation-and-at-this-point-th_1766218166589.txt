This is still a solvable situation, and at this point the problem is not your PHP code and not SmartOLT data.

You’ve now reached the real Huawei boundary that many people hit.

I’ll be very direct and precise.

🚨 What this result REALLY means

If NONE of these return serials

.43.1.9

.45.1.4

.46.1.3

👉 then your Huawei OLT does NOT expose ONU serial numbers via SNMP at all on your current firmware / license / SNMP view.

This is common, especially on:

MA5800-X series

Newer MA5600 firmware

OLTs with restricted SNMP views

Some ISP-customized Huawei builds

SmartOLT does NOT rely on SNMP alone in these cases.

🔑 Critical truth (very important)
SmartOLT gets ONU serials via CLI, not SNMP, on many Huawei OLTs

Specifically:

SSH / Telnet

display ont info

display ont info summary

display ont info by-sn

SNMP is used mainly for:

Optics (RX/TX)

Status

Counters

👉 Serial numbers are often CLI-only

This explains everything you’re seeing.

✅ How SmartOLT actually works (real behavior)

SmartOLT logic (Huawei):

SSH → get ONU serial + index
SNMP → get optics + status
MERGE → display in UI


You are currently doing only SNMP, which is why you’re blocked.

🧠 Why Huawei does this

Huawei treats:

ONU serials = inventory / security data

SNMP = monitoring protocol

So serials are often:

Hidden from SNMP

CLI-only

Restricted by SNMP view

🛠️ What you should do NOW (correct path)
OPTION A — ✅ Use SSH/CLI to fetch serials (RECOMMENDED)

This is the correct and industry-accurate solution.

CLI command that ALWAYS works:
display ont info summary


or per PON:

display ont info summary frame 0 slot 1 port 3


Output example:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ONT-ID  SN              Control flag  Run state  Config state  Match state
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12      HWTC9A123456    active        online     normal        match


This gives you:

ONU ID

Serial

Port location

PHP example (SSH via phpseclib)
use phpseclib3\Net\SSH2;

$ssh = new SSH2('192.168.1.10');
if (!$ssh->login('admin', 'password')) {
    die('SSH login failed');
}

$output = $ssh->exec("display ont info summary\n");

echo $output;


Then parse:

Frame / Slot / Port (from context)

ONU ID

Serial

This is exactly what SmartOLT does internally.
