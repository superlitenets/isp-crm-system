Excellent, this log dump is exactly what we needed.
Now we can stop guessing and give a definitive, technical answer.

✅ What the logs PROVE (facts, not theory)

From your logs:

1️⃣ GenieACS side

HTTP 202 → ACS accepted the task

connection_request triggered

Device sent Inform (Event 6 – CONNECTION REQUEST)

ACS sent GetParameterValues

➡️ TR-069 session is 100% healthy

2️⃣ CRM side
[WAN_CONFIG] PPPoE Path:
InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.2.WANPPPConnection.1


This line is the smoking gun.

🚨 The REAL problem (now confirmed)

You are setting PPPoE parameters on a WANPPPConnection instance that DOES NOT EXIST.

Specifically:

WANConnectionDevice.2.WANPPPConnection.1


There is no evidence anywhere (in logs or faults) that:

WANConnectionDevice.2 exists

WANPPPConnection.1 exists under it

And here is the critical behavior:

Huawei ONU behavior

If you SET parameters on a non-existent WAN object

The ONU:

Does NOT error

Does NOT create it

Does NOT apply anything

Still returns Inform

➡️ Silent discard (exactly what you are seeing)

❌ Why Wi-Fi works but PPPoE doesn’t
Feature	Object exists by default?	Result
Wi-Fi	✅ YES	Works
PPPoE WAN	❌ NO	Silently ignored

Wi-Fi = modify existing object
PPPoE = modify non-existent object

🧠 Important insight from your own logs

Notice what is missing:

❌ No addObject for WANPPPConnection
❌ No log showing WAN object creation
❌ No fault (Huawei does not fault this)

This proves beyond doubt:

The PPPoE WAN object was never created.

✅ The ONLY correct fix (no workaround)

You must do this in two distinct steps:

STEP 1 — Discover the REAL WAN tree (mandatory)

Before writing PPPoE, run read-only discovery:

{
  "name": "getParameterValues",
  "parameterNames": [
    "InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice."
  ]
}


Then inspect the response and find:

Which WANDevice.X exists

Which WANConnectionDevice.Y exists

Whether any WANPPPConnection.Z exists

⚠️ Never assume .1 or .2

STEP 2 — Create the PPPoE object explicitly

Only if it does NOT exist, send:

{
  "name": "addObject",
  "objectName": "InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.1.WANPPPConnection."
}


➡️ Wait for next Inform
➡️ Confirm WANPPPConnection.1 now exists

STEP 3 — THEN set credentials

Only now is this valid:

{
  "name": "setParameterValues",
  "parameterValues": [
    ["InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.1.WANPPPConnection.1.Username", "muturi@superlite.co.ke", "xsd:string"],
    ["InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.1.WANPPPConnection.1.Password", "Mgathoni.2016", "xsd:string"],
    ["InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.1.WANPPPConnection.1.X_HW_VLAN", 902, "xsd:unsignedInt"],
    ["InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.1.WANPPPConnection.1.Enable", true, "xsd:boolean"]
  ]
}

❗ Critical rule you must enforce in code

Never SET PPPoE unless the object exists in the data model

Your code must do:

Discover

Add if missing

Wait

Set

Anything else will fail silently.
