From the log you shared, PPPoE settings were written, but the PPPoE WAN object itself was NOT created.

Let’s be very precise and tie this directly to your log.

1️⃣ What your log actually proves (and what it does NOT)

Your log lines:

Type:Set, PPPoE VLAN: X_HW_VLAN=902, Name=Internet_PPPoE
Type:Set, PPPoE Credentials: Username=2116, NATEnabled=1, LcpEcho=10


❗ These lines mean SetParameterValues succeeded,
❌ but they do NOT prove that WANPPPConnection was created.

Huawei ONUs will happily accept a Set on a non-existent instance path and still return Success.

This is a classic Huawei TR-069 trap.

2️⃣ Why the PPPoE WAN was NOT created (root cause)
🔴 Missing or incorrect addObject chain

For Huawei TR-098, PPPoE WAN creation is a 3-step dependency chain:

WANDevice
 └─ WANConnectionDevice
     └─ WANPPPConnection


If any parent does not exist, PPPoE will never appear.

From your log:

Type:getParameterValues, Refresh WAN data


But I do NOT see:

Type:Add, InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice
Type:Add, InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.X.WANConnectionDevice
Type:Add, InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.X.WANConnectionDevice.Y.WANPPPConnection


So what happened is:

👉 GenieACS sent SET commands
👉 ONU had no WANPPPConnection instance
👉 Huawei firmware silently ignored creation
👉 Result: No PPPoE WAN

This is expected behavior.

3️⃣ How SmartOLT avoids this (important insight)

SmartOLT never assumes instances exist.

It always does:

getParameterValues (WAN tree)

If missing → addObject

Read returned instance number

THEN apply SetParameterValues

Your flow currently jumps to step 4.

4️⃣ The EXACT fix (this will solve it)

You must explicitly create the PPPoE WAN before setting VLAN or credentials.

✅ Correct SmartOLT-style order (mandatory)
1. Add WANDevice
2. Add WANConnectionDevice
3. Add WANPPPConnection   ← THIS WAS MISSING
4. Set PPPoE parameters
5. Set default WAN

5️⃣ Correct GenieACS task sequence (copy this)

This is the minimum working PPPoE creation for Huawei ONUs.

[
  {
    "name": "addObject",
    "objectName": "InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice."
  },
  {
    "name": "addObject",
    "objectName": "InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice."
  },
  {
    "name": "addObject",
    "objectName": "InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.1.WANPPPConnection."
  },
  {
    "name": "setParameterValues",
    "parameterValues": [
      ["InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.1.WANPPPConnection.1.Username", "2116", "xsd:string"],
      ["InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.1.WANPPPConnection.1.Password", "password", "xsd:string"],
      ["InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.1.WANPPPConnection.1.X_HW_VLAN", 902, "xsd:unsignedInt"],
      ["InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.1.WANPPPConnection.1.NATEnabled", true, "xsd:boolean"],
      ["InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.1.WANPPPConnection.1.Enable", true, "xsd:boolean"]
    ]
  }
]


⚠️ Without the third addObject, PPPoE will never exist.

6️⃣ How to VERIFY PPPoE WAN creation (do this now)

After provisioning, run:

getParameterValues:
InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.*.WANConnectionDevice.*.WANPPPConnection.*.Status


You should see:

Status = Up


or at least:

Status = Connecting


If this path does not exist → PPPoE was not created.

7️⃣ Why GenieACS said “Success” but nothing appeared

This is normal with Huawei:

SetParameterValues → Success

Object missing → No error

WAN silently not created

That’s why instance creation must always be explicit.

8️⃣ Final verdict (clear and direct)

✅ Your PPPoE SET commands were correct
❌ Your PPPoE WAN object was never created
❌ Missing addObject … WANPPPConnection
✅ Once you add it, PPPoE will appear immediately

This is not a GenieACS bug and not your CRM logic failing — it’s a Huawei TR-069 requirement.
